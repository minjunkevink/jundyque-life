Daydreaming about becoming a nomad.

# Motivation

With one more year to go in my undergrad, I got an email from our property manager asking to re-sign our lease. My situation is pretty unique compared to my three other roomates in the sense that I:

```
1. want to go to grduate school right after my ugrad
2. supposed to graduate in F'26 (December)
3. don't really have to graduate in F'26 if I don't have to (i.e. if I don't get into any grad programs)
```

With these three conditions in mind I didn't really want to get myslef into a hassle where I signed a year-long lease and then after living here only for 3 months, having to find someone to sublease my room over to.

Would this still be less of a hassle than going through a whole process of by a new car just to sleep in it with less amenities? Absolutely. But let me explain:

Since high school, I've been fascinated by the philosophy of minimalism. To carry less things with you means less burden and more freedom, physically and mentally. As a freshman in high school first moving into my dorm room, the constant flying back and forth from Massacusetts to South Korea made me realize that out of all the things that I own in my room, there are really quite a few things that really matter to me. Ever since then, I've been aggressively getting rid of things that doesn't bring much utility to me. In a sense, this brought me peace that I could not quite explain. The fact that I was able to go anywhere in the world knowing that all I ever need is right there with me was a feeling that felt so free.



Maybe I should first tell you guys my non-negotiables when it comes to my living space:

### 1. I Need to Sleep By Myself
This has many reasons, partly due to my preferences and partly due to the fact that I most likely will be a nuisance to others.
 - I tend to snore very loudly (as per my girlfriend)
 - I fall asleep watching youtube videos
 - I move around a lot

### 2. I
