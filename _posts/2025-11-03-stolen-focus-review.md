**Rating: ★★★☆☆**

# TL;DR

I feel like you could honestly say the same thing he said in a 1500 word essay instead of a whole book.

# Key Takeaways

### 1. It's okay to be bored.
I haven't realized that compared to times when SFF (short form factor) content became widly public, I didn't constatnly try to squeeze in content at very possible dull moments throughout my day; waiting for the elevator, the professor setting up his lecture slides, waiting for my food to cook, etc. I want to try to decrease stimulation in my life overall. For example, I don't HAVE to be listening to music when I shower, nor do I need it when I run. I don't need to be watching a Youtube video if I'm tired: I could just lie down and rest a little.

### 2. Have a concious stream of thought.
It is no understatement when I say my attention span is **cooked** from short form content. When I procrastinate from homework and watch some Youtube videos, procrasinate from **procrastinating** by pausing on the Youtube video to watch some Youtube Shorts. Or, I'll have a Netflix show playing on my computer while scrolling on Instagram Reels while calling my girlfriend. Yeah, I think it's about time I admit that this is just not okay. From now on I will be more weary of what I consume, and be picky on what I will be doing for the next however-long-hours.

### 3. Non-Fiction is Overrated.
I've read Atomic Habits, How to Win Friends and Influence People, 48 Laws of Power, Intelligent Investor, and much more. I simply don't think a non-fiction book captures the nuances as well as fiction does. I've start reading Great Expectations not to long ago, and the narration on the character and the emotions the character goes through simply let's you feel more present in the book's scene. I don't know, maybe it's just be but I think fiction books can deliver the same message as non-fictions in a more beutiful way.
